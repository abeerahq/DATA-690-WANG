### Python Basics
**Python** is an interpreted language.  The Python interpreter runs a program by executing one statement at a time.
Those doing data analysis or scientific computing make use of **IPython**, an enhanced Python interpreter, or Jupyter notebooks, web-based code notebooks.

**Jupyter *Notebook*,** a type of interactive document for code, text (with or without markup), data visualizations, and other output. 

**Extension .ipynb** - a self-contained file format that contains all of the content (including any evaluated code output) currently in the notebook. 

**Tab Completion** - While entering expressions in the shell, pressing the Tab key will search the namespace for any variables (objects, functions, etc.) matching the characters you have typed so far.
  *Combined with %Run* & *function key-word arguments*
