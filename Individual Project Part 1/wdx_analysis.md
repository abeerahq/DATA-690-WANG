### **Introduction**

#### Background Information (Area of Investigation)

The main area of investigation is understanding the relationship between education and the growth of an economy. I want to explore whether attaining an education has any correlation with GDP growth for countries. Some research shows that there is more growth in GDP among those populations that have attained higher education. Additionally, better economic systems allow countries to provide better education to citizens with better resources for learning. This allows for citizens to obtain education at affordable costs, motivating more of the population to attain education without any financial barrier. The investigation will consist of comparison between 2 third-world countries and 2 first-world countries so 4 countries in total. These countries include United States, Mexico, Germany, and Pakistan. The overall purpose of this investigation is to explore how education level of citizens affects the economy of a country.

#### Personal Importance

For any country, it is vital to analyze the major factors that influence the GDP growth of a country. Personally, this topic is important to me because my family is from Pakistan and I was born and raised in the United States. I want to explore how these two countries differ in terms of education and in terms of economical growth. I always wanted to understand the differences in education for first-world and third-world countries. This project will allow me to understand the trends for both type of countries and will give me a clear indication of how education has the ability to impact GDP growth.

#### Questions

The main questions I would like to answer are:

- What is the correlation between education and GDP Per Capita, PPP growth?
- Does higher education attainment among a population increase GDP of a country?
- What are differences between third-world and first-world country's education and GDP?

#### Data Source to Answer Questions

The source for the data and charts used to answer the questions is http://www.worlddev.xyz/ which gets the data from World Bank. 

#### Process to Analyze Issue

In order to analyze the issue, I first selected 2 third-world countries and 2 first-world countries. The third world countries I selected were Pakistan and Mexico. Pakistan was selected because it is my home country, and Mexico was selected because its the third-world country most closest to where I currently live (U.S). The first world countries that were selected are United States and Germany. I wanted to choose countries from three different continents. 

I chose the variables education and GDP Per Capita, PPP in order to see whether education has an impact on the economy of a country. First, a bubble chart was created in which the trend was analyzed to see the correlation between the two variables. The size of the bubbles in the chart represented the population and they will also be considered to see whether they have any influence in the trend.

Second, line graphs for GDP and post-secondary educational attainment will be analyzed to see another visual of what the trend is overtime. Thirdly, a bar chart for post-secondary educational attainment was analyzed just to have another visual representation for comparison. The table will also be analyzed to see in detail the individual data values.

### Results
